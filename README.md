This repo contains demos and quick starts for the various built in AI/ML functions that are present in Confluent Cloud for use with Flink. To get started esure you have a confluent cluster started with a Flink compute pool located in the same region. Once it is running the above demos can be ran to get an idea of what is possible with Flink in Confluent Cloud or as a quick start. 

There are currently 7 AI/ML functions specifically for Confluent Flink. The ones bolded are the ones currently with quick starts located above in the .md files 

**AI_COMPLETE: Generate text completions.**  
AI_EMBEDDING: Create embeddings.  
**AI_FORECAST: Forecast trends.**  
AI_TOOL_INVOKE: Invoke MCP tools.  
**ML_DETECT_ANOMALIES: Detect anomalies in your data.**  
ML_EVALUATE: Evaluate the performance of an AI/ML model.  
ML_PREDICT: Run a remote AI/ML model for tasks like predicting outcomes, generating text, and classification.
