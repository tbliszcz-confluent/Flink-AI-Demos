Embeddings in AI are dense, low-dimensional vector representations of high-dimensional data (like words, images, users, or items) that capture their semantic meaning and relationships. 

In more plain terms -- When you run a piece of data such as an image through an embedding model, you get a short list of numbers that act like a summary of what the picture shows. The numbers then let AI systems do things such as find similar pictures and compare it to other pictures. 

In this quickstart for consistency we will use a OpenAI embeddings model to get embeddings from text we send to it. However you can use other embedding models that are available. 

Like other quickstarts, you will need to get your own OpenAI API key. You must also put a couple of dollars on it to be able to pull from the OpenAI API. An OpenAI API Key can be created at: 

1. Create a connection to OpenAI if you do not currently have one set up:

2. Create an embedding model

3. Create the table we will input data to.

4. Input Data

5. View results
